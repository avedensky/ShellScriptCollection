# Shell Script Collection
My collection of shell scripts for linux and windows.

This collection sample off scripts for quick copy past or modification and added new logic.

<b>Ping scripts</b>
Several scripts that test host by ping and execute some logic:

This script check host by ping, and just show ok or not ok.
Very easy to add new logic, use this script as protoype.

This script check host by ping, and write to log file with current date.

For example, part of log file:
2017-06-14 20:45:02 126.0.0.1 - ping NOT OK
2017-06-14 20:45:18 127.0.0.1 - ping OK
