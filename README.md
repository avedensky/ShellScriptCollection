# Shell Script Collection
My collection of shell scripts for linux and windows.

This collection sample off scripts for quick copy past or modification and added new logic.

<b>Ping scripts</b><br>
Several scripts that test host by ping and execute some logic:

<a href="https://github.com/avedensky/ShellScriptCollection/blob/master/linux/check_ping/ping_sh">ping_sh</a><br>
This is linux bash script, check host by ping, and just show ok or not ok.<br>
Very easy to add new logic, use this script as protoype.

<a href="https://github.com/avedensky/ShellScriptCollection/blob/master/linux/check_ping/ping2log_sh">ping2log_sh</a><br>
This is linux bash script, check host by ping, and write to log file with current date.<br>
<br>For example, part of log file:<br>
2017-06-14 20:45:02 126.0.0.1 - ping NOT OK<br>
2017-06-14 20:45:18 127.0.0.1 - ping OK<br>
